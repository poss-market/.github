# Two Goals of poss market 🙋‍♀️

## 👋 Your company's perspective: Goal #1 - Pay for the software to receive reliable products from trusted vendors  
Business receives reliable open source software that is maintained on a daily basis, features are constantly developed and they receive a support from open source creators

#### Why?
It's cheaper to pay a few (dozens / hundreds / thousands) bucks each year for a library, tool, component, etc instead of build it on your own, maintain, test, take care of security updates, do customer support 

## 🧙 Yours (open source developer's) perspective: Goal #2 - Get paid to build, maintain and support your software 
You as a developer make money by selling licenses to your open source software

#### Why not free open source?
Because you still need a day job and do your open source after hours. Thousands (millions?) of companies make millions (billions?) dollars each year by incorporating your software in their products or using your software in their ecosystem, but you are left with $0 profit from it

#### But I want my open source to be available to regular people for free
With poss market license it remains free for non-profit/personal/scientific users, if you choose to

#### How can I start selling?
It's still dev env, but you can check out https://poss.market 

I will let you know once it's ready for production use
